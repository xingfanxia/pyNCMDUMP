# pyNCMDUMP

This is a simple commandline tool that helps you convert an encrypted `.ncm` file into its original, more commonly seen audio types (e.g. `flac` and `mp3`). 

## Dependencies

- Python3
- [TQDM](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) package, which can be installed through `pip3 install tqdm`
- [PyCrypto](https://www.pycrypto.org) package, which can be installed through `pip3 install pycrypto`

## Usage

The usage would require basic knowledge of running Python3 in a terminal (long/short arguments are inter-changable in examples below):

```
$ python3 ncmdump.py --help


  usage: ncmdump.py [-h] [-w] paths [paths ...]

  pyNCMDUMP command-line interface

  positional arguments:
    paths            one or more paths to source files

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help       show this help message and exit
    -w , --workers   parallel convertion when set to more than 1 workers (default: 1)
```

Example of single-worker mode (default):

```
$ python ncmdump.py A b.ncm
